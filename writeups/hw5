Note that you won't need to unload the existing kernel network driver
to run this program.  Give a short explain what this might imply.

  Because we don't have to unload the existing kernel driver this
means we could use a userspace driver to work with a kernel driver.
Or have multiple userspace drivers all working on hardware. Or we
could sabotage a driver.
